zones hold nodes
nodes hold instances

zones have one main "zone controller", where redis is replicated to

      (Redis)
[Master] -> [Zone us-west-1] -> Node 0-100
	    [Zone us-east-1] -> Node 0-100
	    [Zone us-south-1] -> Node 0-100
	    [Zone us-central-1] -> Node 0-100 


on api request for new node
    (HTTPS)      (randomly chosen based on load)
(User) -> [Load Balancer] -> [API]  
			     [API]
			     [API]
			     [API]
    (gRPC)
[API] -> [Zone (specified)]

	   (Redis pubsub ??)
[Zone (specified)] -> Node broadcast with provisioning information

If node has same disk as requested, and CPU load is okay:
	Respond with "OK", proceed to deploy VPS


Node should:
	* Create VPS
	* Assign disk to VM
	* Create a new NIC, and pass through all traffic (as well as give it a specific MAC prefix)
	* Start VPS to provision it
	* SSH into VPS, then reset the SSH key to one specified by the user
	* Shut down VPS
	* Ask for a new public IP for the box


** ALL VPS IMAGES SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY SETUP THE IP INTERFACE !! **
